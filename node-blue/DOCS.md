# Node-BLUE Hass.io Add-on

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the “Node-BLUE” add-on in the Supervisor add-on store.
2. Install the "Node-BLUE" add-on.
3. Start the "Node-BLUE" add-on
4. Check the logs of the "Node-BLUE" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

The Node-BLUE add-on supports no configuration options as it is automatically configured for you:

-   It connects to Home Assistant automatically
-   It creates a `node-blue` folder within the `share` folder for you to put your `node` files
